# How to play

You need to know chess rules, so whites plays first, so you need to select your piece, to select a piece you need to past the position with this format: "e4", so first its a letter between [a-h] and then a number between [1-9], so if i want to move tha white pawn in the front of the king i should type in my terminal this command 
``
Select your piece
``

``
e4
``

After that you need to move your piece into a position, to select a position you type the same way you typed to select a piece, so in our previous example if had selected pawn of e4 and i want to move him into e6, i just type e6, like that in your terminal
terminal this command 
``
Select your move
``

``
e6
``
